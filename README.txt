debug.keystore info:

Each installation of Android studio creates own key store. 
For using the same Google API key this store should be shared. 
put to: ~/.andorid/debug.keystore.
previous one could be renamed and keep in the same folder

Example for windows 10: c:\Users\User\.android\




For Release version just build the signed APK.
